# Description

If you also want a treelink, I can make it available. (Soon you will just have to add a JSON file to change the links) <br/>
ðŸ“±This repository is also responsive for mobile devices!

## Why?

I needed a linktree and I also wanted to code something quickly in react, in short the perfect combination!!

## Finally

This app was built with Vite, Scss, React.
